Here my observation:
1.taking array to store the fib series took 4 ms
2. using swap operation took 13 ms
3. using recursive call took 19 ms

conclusion:
third case It is using expensive stack operation
secind case extra operation of swap used
first case It is just bare addition but there is more space complexity
